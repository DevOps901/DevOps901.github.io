# Devin Azzie Personal Profile Website - DevOps901.github.io

## Description 
A project was given to us to develop a website which will act as a personal profile/digital CV. Tasks were assigned each day and the project had to be live by day's end. This site was based off of a Bootstrap 4 Site template that was found for a freelancer and then adapted as a personal digital profile.

## Features
*Header/Landing Page

## Requirements
Day 1 had us initially create a header for our page which included our name, a picture of us and then links to our Gthub page and LinkedIn accounts. 

Day 2 we had to add an about me section as well as a significant projects section.

Day 3 we were tasked with adding in an education/certification section.

Day 4 we were tasked with improving our site in whichever way we felt it needed improving and ensuring it was fully mobile-friendly. A skills section was added as well as a full CV download button at the bottom of the page.

## Troubleshooting
### Header Image issue with mobile 
There was an issue with viewing the  site on mobile in a rotated view where the profile name text appeared to be running into the next section because the background image was too short and it was solved by linking the background image to the container it was within raher than giving the image a predefined size. This made th image more adaptive to however it was being veiwed.

### Struggled to add a background image to the header section
Issue was fixed by adding a custom header.masthead css styling which put the background image into the website section.
